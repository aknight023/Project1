## What it Solves
This app makes it quick and easy to find a good show to go to, then find a place nearby for a bite to eat.

## What It Does
* Gets City, State and/or Zip from End User
* Pulls Information from Ticketmaster and Yelp, Respectively
* Gets Location-Based Venues from Ticketmaster and Yelp API’s
* Writes Venues to Screen, Awaits End User Response
* After User Responds, Writes Restaurants to Screen, Awaits Response
* Takes User Input and Writes It to Screen, Pushes Information to Firebase for Recent Searches Box on Home Screen

## What It Uses
* Firebase – Stores Other Users’ Searches and Puts Them on Homepage
* Materialize – Makes the Website Pretty, Restaurant/Event Card System
* Bootstrap – Also Makes the Website Pretty, Alerts/Grid System
* Moment.JS – Decrypts Dates and Times Sent from API’s
* Yelp API – Gets the Restaurant Information in the Selected Area
* Ticketmaster API – Gets Information on Events in the Selected Area
* jQuery – Makes it a Lot Easier to Write to HTML Document
* CORS – Uses a Proxy to Enable API Cross-Origin
